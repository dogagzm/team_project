# Team Project #1

## Description

In your assigned team of 4, you'll collaboratively create a program with a database to analyze data from an open-sourced dataset. 

For example, your team might wish to examine the relationship between the length of a movie and the ratings users give the movie on a popular website. Or you may wish to explore the relationship between the size of a dog breed and the associated genetic ailments of that breed. Teams are encouraged to pick a dataset that interests you, and is robust enough that you have flexibility to practice your skills. 

The task in front of your team is deliberately open-ended. Your team will have to make decisions together:
* How will you select your dataset?
* How will you make sure all team members can contribute to the project?
* How will you make decisions?
* What is the question you're trying to answer through your data analysis?
* What tasks need to be completed to get to your final output?

At the end of the module, all team members are encouraged to fork the repo onto their profile so that prospective employers can view the project. 

Datasets you can use:
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [collections (datahub.io)](https://datahub.io/collections)
* [Dataset Search (google.com)](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
* [Data.gov Home - Data.gov](https://data.gov/) (US)
* [Datasets and Portals (science.gc.ca)](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/open-science/datasets-and-portals)
* [Welcome - Ontario Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/)

The Technical Facilitator will deliver brief learning sessions on the following topics:

* GitHub and coding best practices when working in a team  
* How to communicate the value and impact of their work
  
This project applies skills from the following previous modules:

* Introduction to Building Software (Git, Shell & Python) 
* SQL 
* Applying Statistical Concepts (Linear regression, classification, and resampling) 

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of team project, participants will be able to:
* Resolve merge conflicts
* Describe common problems or challenges a team encounters when working collaboratively in GitHub
* Create a program to analyze a dataset with contributions from multiple team members

## Instructions

1. Explore the open source datasets above.
2. As a team, decide which dataset you would like to analyze and determine:
    1. What is the primary focus within the dataset?
    2. What are potential relationships in the data that you could explore?
    3. What are key questions your project could answer? 
3. Create rules of engagement to guide how your team will work together (Examples can be found under Resources).
4. Create a new repository for your project. Hint: this repo has some features commonly found in industry repos. 
5. Work on the "Advanced Topics" section of [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) to learn more about rebasing
6. Learn why merge conflicts occur via this [article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts#:~:text=Understanding%20merge%20conflicts,automatically%20determine%20what%20is%20correct.)
7. Determine what roles the various team members will play on the team, which tasks need to be completed and assigned to which team members, and what your team norms will be with respect to code reviews, approvals and merges. 
8. Each time you work on the project, add a log to the repository's README indicating what was accomplished. 
9. At the end of the week, please record a 3-5 minute video individually that answers the following questions:
    1. What did you learn?
    2. What challenges did you face?
    3. How did you overcome those challenges?
    4. If you had more time to complete your project, what would you add to it?
    5. What strengths do you bring to a team work environment?
10. Have fun! This project is yours. This is the time to create something that prospective employers can consider when reviewing your application for a role. What will your project tell them about you, your skills and your ability to work effectively on a team. 
  
## Questions to discuss when reviewing your dataset

* What are the key variables and attributes in your dataset?
* How can we explore the relationships between different variables?
* Are there any patterns or trends in the data that we can identify?
* Who is the intended audience for our data analysis?
* What is the question our analysis is trying to answer?
* Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to our project requirements?

## Requirements 
* Each team member must create, review, and merge a pull request 
* Each team member must contribute to the repositoryâ€™s log 
* Each project must design, implement, and test regression 
* Each team must create Rules of Engagement 
* Each team member must create a video about their learnings and experience
