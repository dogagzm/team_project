### Key Questions

* How will you select your dataset?

* How will you make sure all team members can contribute to the project?

* How will you make decisions?

* What is the question you're trying to answer through your data analysis?

* What tasks need to be completed to get to your final output?

---

### Requirements

1. Each team member must __create, review, and merge a pull request__.

2. Each team member must __write one PR description__.

3. Each project must __design, implement, and test regression__.

4. Each team must __create a README__ that explains  the project, how the team approached their project, and any relevant details to their team project, including the team's Rules of Engagement. Keep in mind that the repo will be on each team member's profile, so be thoughtful about the details you include here.

5. Each team member must __create a video__ about their learnings and experience.

---

### Submission

* Each team must fork the `team_project` Git repository.

* The folder structure of your forked repository may be modified to suit your needs.

## 2. Identify an opportunity

Where can you add business value by enabling better informed decisions?

**Example:** We notice that office space appears to be under-utilized. We want to explore the idea of reducing office space while maintaining the same level of productivity and comfort for employees.

## 3. Scope your analysis

What data do you need?

Do you have the resources to acquire additional data?

## 3. Scope your analysis

What data do you need?

Do you have the resources to acquire additional data?

**Example:** We want to explore the data on:

1. How often employees work from the office vs. work from home.
2. Whether teams tend to all work in the office on the same days.
3. The cost to acquire new office spaces.
4. The cost to modify existing office spaces.
5. Whether public transit conditions affect employees' choice of work location.
6. How our rate of working remotely compares with other companies and other industries.

## 4. Develop your solution

1. Integrate your data.

2. What are the key findings?

**Example:**

We can compare the available office space to the space being used under a variety of conditions. This could include breaking the data down by building, floor, team, day of the week, month, and weather. We can investigate the capacitiy of different office layouts, an analyze the tradeoffs involved.

## 5. Present results and recommendations.

Follow-up studies?

Implementable changes (if applicable)?

**Example:** Perhaps designated work-from-home days per team would help. Perhaps it would make more sense to have less overall office space but more efficient use.

## Check: are your insights actionable?

Insights are far more impactful if they are ***actionable***.

---

## Check: how robust is your analysis?

How can you quantify the value that you are providing?

---

## Check: what are the caveats or unknowns?

Are you missing data that would provide more insight?

Is there a risk of false correlation?

How do we monitor whether these trends continue?
