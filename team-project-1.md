# Team Project #1

## Description

In your assigned team of 4, you'll collaboratively create a simple program with a database to analyze a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or another open-sourced dataset. For example, your team might choose to analyze the overall feedback given by customers for an airline.

Every team member will contribute to the project equally and overcome challenges together. For example, one of the challenges you will face is resolving merge conflicts due to conflicting changes.

This project will be used as part of your portfolio, and will also foster collaboration, innovation, and problem-solving skills essential for success in the ever-evolving field of data science and machine learning.

Datasets you can use:

* [collections (datahub.io)](https://datahub.io/collections)
* [Dataset Search (google.com)](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
* [Data.gov Home - Data.gov](https://data.gov/) (US)
* [Datasets and Portals (science.gc.ca)](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/open-science/datasets-and-portals)
* [Welcome - Ontario Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/)

If you have another dataset resource you would like to use, reach out to the DSI team via the #question channel on Slack.

Skills used:

* Shell
* Git
* Python
* SQL
* Estimation, Machine Learning and Testing

## Guiding Questions

* What are the key variables and attributes in our dataset?
* How can we explore the relationships between different variables?
* Are there any patterns or trends in the data that we can identify?
* Who is the intended audience for our data analytic?
* Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to our project requirements?

## Learning Outcomes

* Identify the causes of merge conflicts
* Use rebasing to solve merge conflicts
* Create a program as a team to analyze a dataset

## Instructions

1. Discuss with your team, what you all would like to create. Explore [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) for some ideas using their dataset
    1. What is the primary focus within the dataset on what you want to analyze?
2. Create rules of engagements as a team (this is to help prevent potential issues down the road) (Examples can be found under Resources)
3. One person on your team will create a copy of this template repository via GitHub Classroom
4. Work on the "Advanced Topic" of [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) to learn more about rebasing
5. Learn why merge conflicts occurs via this [article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts#:~:text=Understanding%20merge%20conflicts,automatically%20determine%20what%20is%20correct.)
6. Have fun and work on it!
7. Each time you work together, record down what you did using the repository's README under "Logs"
8. At the end of the week, please record a 5 minutes video as a team:
    1. What did you learn?
    2. What challenges did you face?
    3. How did you overcome those challenges?
    4. What future expansions would you like to add if you got more time to work on it?

## FAQs

### Will we be doing everything by ourselves?

Yes! This team project will be done all by you and your team. The Technical Facilitator will be present however to help when needed, and to check in on your progress of work.

### Why are the teams assigned rather than us choosing who to work with?

There are a few reasons for why we made the groups than letting you all choose:

1. There are a lot of you!
2. Some of you are in the Machine Learning stream, and the rest are in the Data Science stream. We need to organize and group you based on your stream.
3. Any new company you join, you will likely be working with people you never worked with before.
4. You get to meet more people in the community!

### Why do we have to create Rules of Engagement?

Every team needs Rules of Engagement, so every team member is aware of how to work well with each other, and how to resolve team conflict if it ever arises.

### A member is not contributing or taking too long to respond! What should I do?

If someone is taking too slow to respond, try the following:

1. DM them on Slack
2. Email them
3. Reach out to the Technical Facilitator and let them know of the issues

### Are we supposed to work on the same hours if lectures and office hours were held?

Ideally yes!

### Will the Technical Facilitator be checking our work throughout the week?

Yes! They will be periodically checking your team's work for progress.

### Will we be using this project in Team Project #2?

Yes! We will be working together again and expanding on the project.
