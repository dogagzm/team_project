# Team Project #2

## Description

In the same team from the first team project, you'll take your existing program and collaboratively create and either visualize the data or deploy a machine learning model for it. For example, your team might choose to develop a sentiment analysis model for social media comments in order to enable businesses to gauge public opinion effectively.

This project will be used as part of your portfolio, and will also foster collaboration, innovation, and problem-solving skills essential for success in the ever-evolving field of data science and machine learning.

_Reminder: Please add in the additional file structures found on the README.md._

Skills used:

* Shell
* Git
* Python
* SQL
* Applying Statistical Concepts
* Production
* Visualization (Data Science Specialization only)
* Sampling (Data Science Specialization only)
* Algorithm & Data Structures (Machine Learning Specialization only)
* Deep Learning (Machine Learning Specialization only)

## Data Visualization Guiding Questions

* What are the main goals and objectives of our visualization project?
* How can we tailor the visualization to effectively communicate with our audience?
* What type of visualization best suits our data and objectives (e.g., bar chart, scatter plot, heatmap)?
* Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to our project requirements?
* How can we iterate on our design to address feedback and make iterative improvements?
* What best practices can we follow to promote inclusivity and diversity in our visualization design?
* How can we ensure that our visualization accurately represents the underlying data without misleading or misinterpreting information?
* Are there any privacy concerns or sensitive information that need to be addressed in our visualization?

## Machine Learning Model Guiding Questions

* What are the specific objectives and success criteria for our machine learning model?
* How can we select the most relevant features for training our machine learning model?
* Are there any missing values or outliers that need to be addressed through preprocessing?
* Which machine learning algorithms are suitable for our problem domain?
* What techniques can we use to validate and tune the hyperparameters for our models?
* How should we split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets?
* Are there any ethical implications or biases associated with our machine learning model?
* How can we document our machine learning pipeline and model architecture for future reference?

## Learning Outcomes

* Create a data visualization as a team
* Create a machine learning model as a team

## Instructions

1. Meet up with your team again
2. Review the Rules of Engagement you created together and revise it if necessary
3. Discuss what data visualization or machine learning model you want to create based on your existing data
4. Have fun and work on it!
5. Each time you work together, record down what you did using the repository's README under "Logs"
6. At the end of the week, please record a 5 minutes video as a team:
    1. What did you make?
    2. What did you learn?
    3. What challenges did you face?
    4. How did you overcome those challenges?
    5. What future expansions would you like to add if you got more time to work on it?

## FAQs

### A member is not contributing or taking too long to respond! What should I do?

If someone is taking too slow to respond, try the following:

1.  DM them on Slack
2.  Email them
3.  Reach out to the Technical Facilitator and let them know of the issues

### Will we be doing everything by ourselves again?

Yes! This team project will be done all by you and your team. The Technical Facilitator will be present however to help when needed, and to check in on your progress of work.

### Are we supposed to work on the same hours if lectures and office hours were held?

Ideally yes!

### Will the Technical Facilitator be checking our work throughout the week?

Yes! They will be periodically checking your team's work for progress.
